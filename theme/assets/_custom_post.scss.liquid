/*
  Theme custom overrides
  - Add your custom override scss here to be included in the final stylesheet.
  
  DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE LOCALLY.
  If you are running the shopify theme gem and you edit this file locally you will override what currently exists on Shopify.
  For best results only edit this file inside the Shopify template editor in your stores admin.
  
  Once this file exists in your assets in Shopify you will need to ignore it in your theme gem config:
    :ignore_files:
    - assets/_custom_post.scss.liquid
